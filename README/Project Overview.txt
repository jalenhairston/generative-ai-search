Welcome to the Generative AI Search app! As a software engineer at Insight Enterprises, I am creating this web
application as a side project leveraging various generative AI APIs and the Angular 17 framework. This project is
intended to develop and solidify skills in development, design, and process for front end while adding practical value.
The application will allow users to enter a prompt to recieve responses from multiple generative AI models, and assist
users in selecting the best response.

Generative AI Search consists of a search prompt screen, a results view with a table to view the AI generated responses,
and detailed views of each provided result. The generated responses also include relevant images and urls to search
engine results for the given prompt. This functionality is comprised of components designed in Angular. The components
used include:
    -Search Bar
    -Search Screen Template
    -Result Screen Template
    -Angular Materials Table
    -Result Detail Screen
    -Footer

The project's development thus far includes planning and research for using Angular and the Gen AI models implemented,
creation and styling of the above components, routing between the user views, creation of a service to retreive and
store data, and implementation of a Gemini AI model API to handle prompts and return responses.
